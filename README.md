# Obsidian HTML Tags Autocomplete

### Autocomplete HTML tags. It's as simple as that.

This plugin does three things:
 1. **Add closing tag.** When typing HTML tags for formatting, the closing tag will be suggested. For example, for subscripts in text you type `<sub>` and this plugin will add the closing `</sub>` tag for you.
 
 2. **Modify matching tag.** If you modify an HTML tag, its matching tag will also be updated.

 3. **Skip over tags.** When using `ctrl + ->` or `ctrl + <-` to move when next to or inside of a tag, the cursor is moved outside of the tag.
