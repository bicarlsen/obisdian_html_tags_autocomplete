# Obsidian HTML Tags Autocomplete

### Autocomplete HTML tags. It's as simple as that.

This plugin does three things:
 1. **Add closing tag.** When typing HTML tags for formatting, the closing tag will be suggested. For example, for subscripts in text you type `<sub>` and this plugin will add the closing `</sub>` tag for you.
 
 2. (Coming soon) **Modify matching tag.** If you modify an HTML tag, its matching tag will also be updated.

 3. **Skip over tags.** Skip across the entire tag when moving the cursor next to or inside of a tag.

 ## Commands
 
 Three navigation commands are added with this plugin.

 ### Skipping over tags
 To skip across a tag use the `Skip over tag backward` or `Skip over tag forward` command. these commands are only available when inside of or next to a tag.
 
 **Suggested hotkeys**: `Ctrl + Meta + <-`, `Ctrl + Meta + ->`


 ### Go to matching tag
 When inside of or next to a tag, go to the matching tag, if it exists using the `To matching tag` command.

 **Suggested hotkey:** `Ctrl + m`
